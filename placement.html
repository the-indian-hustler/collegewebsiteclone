      <h2>Why Recruit?</h2>
    <p>  Indian Institute of Information Technology Kota <br>
       (भारतीय सूचना प्रौद्योगिकी संस्थान कोटा) is one of the IIITs established in 2013 <br>
        as a joint venture of the Ministry of Education (MoE), Govt. of India and Govt. of Rajasthan <br>
         with industry partners in Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) model. <br> 
         In 2017, the Institute was declared an “Institute of National Importance” <br>
          under the Indian Institutes of Information Technology (Public-Private Partnership) Act, 2017.
   </p>
   <h2>Finest curriculum</h2>
<p>
    The Institute offers undergraduate programs in Computer Science & Engineering and Electronics & Communications Engineering, <br>
     as well as postgraduate programs like M.Tech. in CSE with specialization in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science and Ph.D. <br>
      in major areas of CSE & ECE. IIIT Kota is well-connected with peer institutes and industries <br>
       to enhance research and development and enrich its educational programs. <br>
     The Institute has laid out a balanced curriculum with a strong emphasis on practical skills <br>
      along with theory and encourages innovations and co-curricular activities. <br>
       IIIT Kota provides an environment that nurtures leaders in addition to industry-ready engineers.

The students of B.Tech. are admitted through Joint Entrance Examination – Main (JEE-Main) <br>
 and represent the top 2% of the candidates that appear for the exam nationwide. <br>
  This section of students possess excellent analytical skills, have a thirst for knowledge, <br>
   and are quick learners. Many former students have distinguished themselves <br>
    through their contributions to and achievements in industries, academia, business, <br>
     government, and social domains. Consequently, the Institute has arisen to become a top choice of students.

<br><br><br><br><br>
<h2>Student Achievement</h2>
<p>With one of the best academic curriculum in India, our students continually <br>
     take part in renowned programming and robotics competitions like ACM ICPC, <br>
      Google Hash Code, e-Yantra, and various hackathons, including national-level <br>
       hackathons like Smart India Hackathon, and have always made their presence felt by performing great. <br>
        We also have many students honing their coding skills on websites like Codeforces, CodeChef and Leetcode, <br>
     contributing to open-source projects on GitHub, and helping others on forums like Stack Overflow.</p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>Industrial Experiencee</h2>
<p>Practical training is an integral part of any technical curriculum. <br>
     Summer training and internships offer students an insight into <br>
      how things work in a professional space. They help students acquaint themselves with the <br>
       real-world application of the technologies they learned on campus. <br>
     This exposure helps students to deliver their best when they join the industry as working professionals.

    The TnP Cell facilitates the practical training of students in organizations of national <br>
     and international repute. Some of the students also get research <br>
      internship offers from foreign institutes. Students also go for research projects as <br>
       summer interns in IITs and other institutes. We have many alumni placed in <br>
        top-notch multinational companies, and each year, we are setting a new placement record.</p>
        <h2>All Round Development</h2>
        <p>The Institute is committed to providing the students opportunities to develop an all-rounded personality. <br>
             Many essential soft skills, including communication, conflict resolution, <br>
              creative problem solving, strategic thinking, team building, are inculcated in the students <br>
               through various classroom and co-curricular activities. <br>
                Also, there are open-ended learning components in the curriculum that enable the <br>
             students to explore their creative sides and develop innovative solutions and projects.</p>
